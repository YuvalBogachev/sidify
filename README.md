# Sidify
A quick and dirty script to transform a given Debian install to an unstable one, using the default mirror.

# How To Use?
Run the following in your terminal:
```sh
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuvalBogachev/sidify/master/sidify.sh)"
```
# Notes
You might be prompted by dialog boxes a few times during the execution of the script, answer 'Yes' to all of them (or something else, if you have specific needs out of the scope of this project).
